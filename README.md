## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt on how to center a flexbox item/s horizontally and vertically.

The snippet below alligns all flexbox items (under .flexbox-container) - horizontally and vertically.

```css
.flexbox-container {
  height: 100vh;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```
